This is the first project for the WDF June 2018 Cohort. This is to create a Pokemon trainer "device" shown on the web browser to display information of the three chosen Pokemon by using AJAX (Axios) to retrieve the data. This Pokedex is for a special trainer that is an octogenarian (who's 88 years old) with simple and basic functionality with a simple button, specifically made for her age without any seizure-causing harsh sounds, moving images and flashing lights.
